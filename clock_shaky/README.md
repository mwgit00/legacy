# Shaky Happy Jingle Clock

This is a clock that uses a rotary solenoid to wiggle a jingling smiley-face cat toy at its alarm time.  It can also wiggle the toy once on the hour.  A simple serial interface can set the time with the help of a terminal application.  A BASIC Stamp 1 handles all the logic.
