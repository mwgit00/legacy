# legacy

Over the last 20 years or so, I've built a variety of clocks, robots, and other gizmos with several different microcontroller brains.  Some of these creations are still functional and may need occasional rework or updates.  Others were cannibalized and no longer exist.  If I find old code for one of my projects, I will try to put it here.

In the olden days, my "version control" scheme was to copy a file or directory and give it an increasing suffix (like 1,2,3 or A,B,C) to make it different from the previous one.  You'll see lots of that in these folders.  Sorry.  As for the code itself, some is well-commented and some is not.  And occasionally you might find some swear words.  None of the project folders are guaranteed to have complete source code or the latest versions that went into their respective hardware.  Things get lost.

In this repository, you'll mainly find code for Parallax BASIC Stamp controllers (BS1, BS2, and BSX) and the obsolete Acroname BrainStem controllers (GP 1.0, GP 2.0, and Moto).
